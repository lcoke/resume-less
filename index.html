                    <p class="ipusinfo">In west Philadelphia born and raised
    On the playground was where I spent most of my days.
    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
    She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

    I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
    And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."
    I looked at my kingdom
    I was finally there
    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air

                <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near
    The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.  If anything I could say that this cab was rare
    But I thought, "Nah, forget it."
    â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air."
